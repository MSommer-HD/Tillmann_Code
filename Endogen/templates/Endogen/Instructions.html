            <b>How the game works</b> : <br>
                - you will play in a group of <b>3 players</b> <br>
                - there is a <b>pool of {{pool}} points</b> <br>
                - The  <b>pool has a baseline chance to break down of 20%</b>, and the more points are taken from the pool, the more likely is a breakdown:
                For every point that you, or your co-players, take from the pool, <b>the chance of breakdown increases by 1%.</b><br>
                - <b>a point is worth 20 cents</b> <br>
                - each player can take between 0 and  10 points from the pool<br>
                - the remaining points in the pool get multiplied by {{ factor }}
                and are distributed amongst all 3 players equally<br>
                - <b>if the pool breaks down </b> you will <b>not</b> get any points from the game.<br><br>

<br>
            <b>Your tasks</b>:<br>
                - choose how many points you want to take from the pool<br>
                - try to guess the number of points remaining in the pool<br><br>
            <b>Your payoff if pool doesn't break down</b>:<br>
                - the amount you take from the pool + your share from the multiplied remaining points of the pool<br>
                - if you correctly guess the amount of points remaining in the pool you get 1 additional point.  <br><br>
               <br><br>
