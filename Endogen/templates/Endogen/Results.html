<! Here we need an if statement, since the players in the treatment determines if he gets info of the pool breaking down or not.
        In this special case we have a nested loop. For those the syntax remains the same as a normal loop>

    <p>
            You took {{take}} points. {{total_points_left}} points remained in the pool and increased to {{pool_mult}} points.<br>
            Since {{points_taken}} points were taken, the chance that the pool broke down was at {{tipping_point}}%.<br><br>

        {% if breakdown == 1 %}
        <br>
             <b>Unfortunately the pool broke down.</b><br>
                This means you will not get any points from the game itself.
            {%else%}
        <br>
             <b>Fortunately the pool did not break down.</b>
                This means your share of the pool is {{share}} points and you can keep the {{take}} points you took.<br><br>
            {% endif %} <br>

        <i>Additional points:</i><br>
            {% if correct_belief == 1 %}
                Your guess on the amount of points left in the pool was <b>correct</b>.
                Therefore you earn one additional point. <br>
            {%else%}
                Your guess on the amount of points left in the pool was <b>false</b>.
                Therefore you do not earn the additional point. <br>
            {%endif%}
<br>
        <b>Total number of your points from the game:</b> {{payoff}}

        <br><br>
        Now you only need to complete a short questionnaire to finish this study and collect the money you earned.<br>
        Remember, the reward for completion of the assignment is <b>$1.</b>
