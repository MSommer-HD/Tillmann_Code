        This is your first of two trial tasks, where you will be asked to answer two questions on a a fictional example.
        These two questions do not give you points but test your understanding of the game.
      <br><br>
            Question 1: <br><br>

            The pool has 30 points in the very beginning.
            Imagine you take 5 points from the pool and the other two players each take 5 points from the pool.
            Therefore 15 points are left in the pool.
